MSAR - Multiple or Mapping Search and Replace
Author:  Michael J. Vincent


DESCRIPTION

Script searches and replaces multiple text items based on a mapfile.

This allows for a "single-pass" search and replace while searching and 
replacing multiple entries.  It can be done column based (e.g., tab-delimted) 
or with free text.  Options for whole word match and case in/sensitive 
are provided.
